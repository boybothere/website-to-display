This is a youtube home page display I had coded through a folloup tutorial.
It covers essentially most HTML and CSS basic properties like:
1. HTML tags
2. Hovers and various transitions
3. Text styles and images editing properties
4. Using tags to open up videos or pages in another website
5. div element and its nesting techniques
6. CSS grid
7. Flexbox
8. CSS positions namely relative, fixed and absolute
Looking forward to make this skill better in my future projects!!

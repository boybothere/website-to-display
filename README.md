This is YouTubes's home page clone  display I had coded through a followup tutorial.
It covers essentially most HTML and CSS basic properties like:
1. HTML tags
2. Hovers and various transitions
3. Text styles and images editing properties
4. Using tags to open up videos or pages in another website
5. div element and its nesting techniques
6. CSS grid
7. Flexbox
8. CSS positions namely relative, fixed and absolute.

Looking forward to make these better in my future projects!!
